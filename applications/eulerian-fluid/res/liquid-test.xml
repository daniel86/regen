From GPU Gems3:
With fire or smoke, we are interested in visualizing a density defined throughout the entire volume,
but with water the visually interesting part is the interface between air and liquid.

Therefore, we need some way of representing this interface and tracking how it deforms
as it is pushed around by the fluid velocity.
The level set method (Sethian 1999) is a popular representation of a liquid surface and is
particularly well suited to a GPU implementation because it requires only a scalar value
at each grid cell. In a level set, each cell records the shortest signed distance phi from the
cell center to the water surface. Cells in the grid are classified according to the value of
phi: if phi < 0, the cell contains water; otherwise, it contains air. Wherever phi equals zero is
exactly where the water meets the air (the zero set). Because advection will not preserve
the distance field property of a level set, it is common to periodically reinitialize the
level set. Reinitialization ensures that each cell does indeed store the shortest distance to
the zero set. However, this property isn't needed to simply define the surface, and for
real-time animation, it is possible to get decent results without reinitialization.
Figure 30-1, at the beginning of this chapter, shows the quality of the results.
Just as with color, temperature, and other attributes, the level set is advected by the fluid,
but it also affects the simulation dynamics.
In fact, the level set defines the fluid domain:
in simple models of water and air, we assume that the air has a negligible effect on the
liquid and do not perform simulation wherever phi >= 0. In practice, this means we set the
pressure outside of the liquid to zero before solving for pressure and modify the pressure
only in liquid cells. It also means that we do not apply external forces such as gravity
outside of the liquid. To make sure that only fluid cells are processed, we check the value
of the level set texture in the relevant shaders and mask computations at a cell if the
value of phi is above some threshold. Two alternatives that may be more efficient are to use
z-cull to eliminate cells (if the GPU does not support dynamic flow control) (Sander et
al. 2004) and to use a sparse data structure (Lefohn et al. 2004).

To render a liquid surface, we also march through a volume, but this time we look at
values from the level set phi. Instead of integrating values as we march, we look for the
first place along the ray where phi = 0. Once this point is found, we shade it just as we
would shade any other surface fragment, using NABLAphi at that point to approximate the
shading normal. For water, it is particularly important that we do not see artifacts of
the grid resolution, so we use tricubic interpolation to filter these values. Figure 30-1 at
the beginning of the chapter demonstrates the rendered results. See Sigg and Hadwiger
2005 and Hadwiger et al. 2005 for details on how to quickly intersect and filter volume
isosurface data such as a level set on the GPU.
