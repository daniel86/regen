From GPU Gems3:
Although the velocity field describes the fluid's motion, it does not look much like a
fluid when visualized directly. To get interesting visual effects, we must keep track of
additional quantities that are pushed around by the fluid. For instance, we can keep
track of density and temperature to obtain the appearance of smoke (Fedkiw et al.
2001). For each additional quantity phi, we must allocate an additional texture with the
same dimensions as our grid. The evolution of values in this texture is governed by the
same advection equation used for velocity:
     d_phi/d_t = -(uNABLA)phi
In other words, we can use the same MacCormack advection routine we used to evolve
the velocity.
To achieve the particular effect we inject a three-dimensional Gaussian "splat" into a color texture
each frame to provide a source of "smoke." These color values have no real physical significance,
but they create attractive swirling patterns as they are advected throughout the volume by the fluid velocity.
To get a more physically plausible appearance, we must make sure that hot smoke rises
and cool smoke falls. To do so, we need to keep track of the fluid temperature T (which
again is advected by u). Unlike color, temperature values have an influence on the dynamics of the fluid.
This influence is described by the buoyant force:
     f_buoyancy = ( P*m*g / R )[1/T0 - 1/T]z
where P is pressure, m is the molar mass of the gas, g is the acceleration due to gravity,
and R is the universal gas constant. In practice, all of these physical constants can be
treated as a single value and can be tweaked to achieve the desired visual appearance.
The value T0 is the ambient or "room" temperature, and T represents the temperature
values being advected through the flow. z is the normalized upward-direction vector.
The buoyant force should be thought of as an "external" force and should be added to
the velocity field immediately following velocity advection.
