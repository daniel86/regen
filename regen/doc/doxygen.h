@section RenderState

`regen` uses regen::RenderState to keep track of most GL states and to avoid
redundant state changes. Avoiding redundant changes is done using the template
class regen::StateStack. The stack compares pushed values with the active value
before calling any GL functions. When a value is popped the previous state
value is activated.

You should always use the RenderState if it provides a state stack for the particular
state of your interest because it keeps track of the value and undefined behavior
will occur when the RenderState assumes a wrong state value.

The RenderState is a singleton. You can only use the singleton instance in the rendering thread.
Multithreading is not supported. RenderState may manages resources that can not be shared between threads
and it does not provide an interface to make the associated context active in the calling thread.

@code
using namespace regen;
// Get the singleton and activate the MULTISAMPLE state
// aka. use multiple fragment samples in computing the final color of a pixel.
// Possibly glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE) will be called with this push
RenderState()::get()->toggles().push(RenderState::MULTISAMPLE, GL_TRUE);
doSomethingWithMultiSampling();
// Pop value, reset to previous value of MULTISAMPLE state
RenderState()::get()->toggles().pop();
@endcode

@section mem Memory management

Dynamic memory allocation is not cheap.
GPU memory is precious.
Explicit deallocation is error-prone.

For these reasons `regen` provides some memory management classes.

@subsection ref_ptr Reference counting

`regen` excessively uses the regen::ref_ptr template class for reference counting.
The template class supports assignment operator and copy constructor.
To access the pointer you can use -> operator.
Intern all references share the same counter, if the counter reaches zero `delete` is called.

You have to explicitly request to manage the memory
with reference counting by calling one of the alloc functions.

Simple usage example:
@code
using namespace regen;
struct Test { int i; }
{
  // create reference counted instance of Test data type.
  // the reference count is 1 after calling this.
  ref_ptr<Test> i0 = ref_ptr<Test>::alloc();
  // assign a new value to the Test instance.
  i0->i = 2;
  // copy the reference pointer, reference count will be 2 afterwards.
  ref_ptr<Test> i1 = i0;
} // reference count reaches zero when leaving this block
@endcode

@subsection mem_pool Memory pools

`regen` supports virtual memory allocation using the regen::AllocatorPool template class.
An AllocatorPool is defined by an actual allocator and an virtual allocator.
Actual allocators are used to actually allocate a block of memory
(a GPU memory allocator may calls glGenBuffers and the initial glBufferData).
The actual block of pre-allocated memory is managed by the virtual allocator.
When someone requests memory from the pool, the pool checks if there is
an virtual allocator with enough contiguous space left. If not the pool may actually allocates
memory for creating a virtual allocator with enough contiguous free space.

Virtual allocators must implement some interfaces used in the pool template class.
The actual unit of the managed memory is arbitrary, it can refer to
KBs, MBs, pages or whatever you need to manage.
For example if you define your unit as pages you can be sure that no one
can allocate blocks smaller then a page-size.
Pools allow to align memory to an integer multiplication of the given
alignment amount. For example if your unit is bytes and you define
an alignment of 16 in the pool, virtual allocators can only allocate
blocks of n*16 bytes.

The actual and virtual allocator types are template arguments, you could define your
own allocator types and use them together with the memory pool.

Currently only one virtual allocator is implemented:
regen::BuddyAllocator, a variant of the buddy memory allocation algorithm.
The algorithm uses a binary tree to partition the pre-allocated memory.
When memory is allocated the algorithm searches for a `free` node that
offers enough space for the request.
When a node was found it is cut into one `full` node that
fits the request exactly and another  `free` node for the remaining space.
Allocating some relative small chunks of memory helps in keeping the
fragmentation low.

In `regen` you normally don't use the pools directly. For buffer objects the regen::VBO class
provides an interface to use memory pool allocation. Here is an simple example:
@code
using namespace regen;
// Create a new VBO.
// The usage flag determines which pool is used for memory allocation
// and it is a hint for the driver to find a good space in VRAM for the data.
ref_ptr<VBO> vbo = ref_ptr<VBO>::alloc(VBO::USAGE_DYNAMIC);
// Allocate virtual memory from the pool using the VBO interface.
VBOReference ref = vbo->alloc(NUM_BYTES);
// Upload data to actual VRAM using the VBOReference.
// The actual upload call `glBufferSubData` is wrapped in a RenderState push and pop
// that makes the referenced buffer the current array buffer.
RenderState()::get()->arrayBuffer().push(ref->bufferID());
glBufferSubData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, ref->address(), NUM_BYTES, cpuDataPtr);
RenderState()::get()->arrayBuffer().pop();
// Mark the allocated block as free when you do not use the data on the GPU
// anymore. If you keep the reference for lifetime of VBO then you do not
// need to free the reference manually.
vbo->free(ref);
@endcode

@note Dynamic memory allocation can be a bottleneck in real-time applications. You should
avoid calling new and delete in the render loop. Use pre-allocated memory instead.

@section Animations
regen::Animation's can implement two different interfaces:
regen::Animation::animate and regen::Animation::glAnimate.
The first one is executed in an dedicated animation thread without GL
context when the function is invoked. The second function will be executed
in the render thread with GL context.
These interfaces can be used to create simple producer-consumer animations
to put some of the computation load on another CPU core.

Animations add themselves to the animation thread when they are constructed.
You can remove them again by calling regen::Animation::stopAnimation.
It is ok to call stop in the above interface functions.

The animation thread is synchronized with the render thread. Each animation is invoked once
in the animation thread and once in the render thread for each rendered frame.

@code
using namespace regen;
class MyAnimation : public Animation
{
public:
  MyAnimation()
  : Animation(GL_TRUE,GL_TRUE)
  {}
  void animate(GLdouble dt)
  {
    doSomethingInAnimThread();
  }
  void glAnimate(RenderState *rs, GLdouble dt)
  {
    doSomethingInRenderThread();
  }
};
@endcode

@section Events
regen::EventObject provides a simple interface for providing sync and async event messages
to other components via callback functions. For async events the connected callbacks
are called after the next frame was rendered within the render thread (with GL context).
For example this event mechanism is used to dispatch GUI events from the GUI thread
to the render thread.

Implementing regen::EventObject is easy. Each regen::EventObject can define multiple named
events by calling the static function regen::EventObject::registerEvent.
This has to be done only once per class (not once per instance).
The function returns an unique event id that can be use to
refer to the registered event.

After the event was registered regen::EventObject implementations can
call regen::EventObject::emitEvent for an synch event or
regen::EventObject::queueEmit for an asynch event.
If you need any special event data you can subclass regen::EventData and
pass it to the emit function.

Listeners can be connected to and disconnted from regen::EventObject's.
Event listeners must subclass regen::EventHandler and implement regen::EventHandler::call.

@code
using namespace regen;

// EventObject's provide events listeners can connect to.
class MyEventObject : public EventObject
{
public:
  // This is the event identifier. We have to call EventObject::registerEvent
  // to set the value.
  static GLuint MY_EVENT;
  // Each time MY_EVENT is emitted a MyEvent instance is generated
  // and passed to connected handlers.
  class MyEvent : public EventData
  {
  public:
    // add relevant data here...
    void *myEventData;
  };

  MyEventObject() : EventObject() {}

  // Instantiate MyEvent and invoke connected listener.
  void emitMyEvent(void *myEventData)
  {
    ref_ptr<MyEvent> event = ref_ptr<MyEvent>::alloc();
    event->myEventData = myEventData;
    // synchronous message
    emitEvent(MY_EVENT, event);
    // asynchronous message
    // queueEmit(MY_EVENT, event);
  }
}
// statically register the event
GLuint MyEventObject::MY_EVENT = EventObject::registerEvent("my-event");

// EventHandler is the interface used to connect to events.
class MyEventHandler : public EventHandler
{
public:
  MyEventHandler(e) : EventHandler() {}

  // EventHandler subclasses must implement this method.
  void call(EventObject *evObject, EventData *evData)
  {
    // If you connect to a single event only, this check is not needed.
    if(evData->eventID == MyEventObject::MY_EVENT)
    {
      // you probably should use dynamic_cast<> and check for NULL pointer
      // but if you don't care and know that the type is right just use unsafe casts
      MyEventObject *obj = (MyEventObject*)evObject;
      MyEvent *ev = (MyEvent*)evData;
      handleEvent(obj,ev);
    }
  }
};

// instantiate and connect handler
MyEventObject evObj;
evObj.connect(MyEventObject::MY_EVENT, ref_ptr<MyEventHandler>::alloc());
evObj.emitMyEvent(NULL);
@endcode

@section Shader Shader Loading
When a shader is loaded the code is pre-processed on the CPU before it is
send to the GL. Regular GLSL code should work fine but the actual
code send to the GL maybe different from the code passed in.

@subsection directives Directive handling
- \#define can be used as usual
- \#ifdef,\#if,\#elif,\#else,\#endif directives are evaluated
  and undefined code is not send to the GL.
- \#line directives are ignored and not send to the GL as they are confusing in
  combination with the pre-processors.
- \#version directives are not send to GL as passed in. The directive processor look
  for the maximum version and at last the \#version directive with
  maximum version is prepended to shader code (ATI is really strict about having
  the version directive the very first statement in the code).

@subsection macro_replace Macro name replacing
Macro names are only replaced by the defined value when explicitly requested
using a special notation. The notation is a leading dollar sign followed by the macro
name surrounded by curly brackets.
For example:
@code
#define FOO 2
int i = ${FOO};
@endcode

@subsection include_directive \#include directive
\#include directives are supported using GLSW. They are evaluated recursively.
You can add custom include paths with regen::Application::addShaderPath.
The include key is build from the shader filename and a named section in the shader.
Nodes in the path are separated by dots.
For example to load the subsection 'bar' from the section 'foo' in the
file 'baz' the include key would be 'baz.foo.bar'.
The actual GLSL code would look like this:
@code
#include baz.foo.bar
@endcode

regen::ShaderState scans for implemented shader stages by appending the shader stage
prefix (regen::glenum::glslStagePrefix) to the include key and compiles all
defined stages into the shader program.

@subsection define2_directive \#define2 directive
Practically the same as \#define with the exception that the define is not
included in the code send to GL. In other words this define can only be used
by CPU pre-processors.
For example this would work as intended:
@code
#define2 HAS_FOO
#ifdef HAS_FOO
do_something();
#endif
@endcode

@subsection for_directive \#for directive
A \#for directive is supported that allows to define code n-times.
Inside the for loop the current index in the for loop can be accessed.
The index is actually defined using the \#define2 directive.
For example following would be repeated 8 times:
@code
#for INDEX to 8
  {
    int i = ${INDEX};
  }
#endfor
@endcode

@subsection io_names IO name matching
The pre-processor handles name matching between shader stages by redefining the
IO names.
It is good practice to use 'in_' and 'out_' prefix for all inputs and outputs
in each shader stage and let the pre-processor decide about the naming.
You could also bypass this suggestion and give the IO data arbitrary names.

For attributes a stage prefix (regen::glenum::glslStagePrefix) is prepended,
uniforms get a 'u_' prefix and constants get a 'c_' prefix.

For example this code is valid:
@code
-- vs
in vec3 in_pos;
out vec3 out_pos;
void main() {
  out_pos = in_pos;
}
-- fs
in vec3 in_pos;
void main() {
  do_something(in_pos);
}
@endcode

@subsection io_gen IO generator
Often you don't do anything special with attributes in a shader stage and only pass
them through to the stage that actually operates on the data.
The pre-processor can generate such pass through code for you. This actually
allows defining shader stages without knowing the input attributes of the following
stage allowing to define more generic shaders.

When a stage is processed the pre-processor iterates over the inputs declared
in the following state and makes sure that there is matching input.
If not a pass through output is generated.

The generator does only operate when you explicitly request it.
The IO code is generated only if you define HANDLE_IO(i) somewhere outside the main
function.
Additionally you have to call this macro somewhere inside the main function.

For example this code would pass an attribute named 'foo' to the fragment shader:
@code
-- vs
#define HANDLE_IO(i)
void main() {
  HANDLE_IO(glVertexID);
}
-- fs
in vec3 in_foo;
void main() {
  do_something(in_foo);
}
@endcode

@subsection io_trans IO transformation
Shader input in this engine is defined as constant input (never changing for a
compiled program), uniform input (not changing during shader invocation),
vertex attribute input (changing per vertex) and instanced attribute input
(changing per instance).
On the CPU all types of input are represented by regen::ShaderInput.

Pre-processors allow transformation from one input type to another.
This allows defining code without knowing the actual type of the input.
For example you can define a simple material shader declaring all
material inputs as constant inputs and this shader could also be used
as instanced material shader or none constant material shader using uniforms.

@section Logging
Use regen::Logging::addLogger to define a logger for a given level.
For example if you would like to see INFO messages on console:
@code
regen::Logging::addLogger(new regen::CoutLogger(regen::Logging::INFO));
@endcode

Use log macros with << operator to log a message:
@code
REGEN_INFO("value="<<value);
@endcode

Use regen::Application::setupLogging if you want to see all log messages on the console.

@section tut_win Creating a window

Instantiate the regen::Application and show the window.
@code
  ref_ptr<QtApplication> app = ref_ptr<QtApplication>::alloc(argc,argv);
  app->set_windowTitle("My Application");
  app->show();
  ref_ptr<StateNode> rootNode = app->renderTree();
@endcode

Finally enter the main loop. This call will block until the engine exits.
@code
app->mainLoop();
@endcode

@section tut_fbo Creating a render target

Instantiate the regen::FBO. Specify texture dimensions and depth texture parameters.
If you set them to anything but GL_NONE the depth texture is automatically attached.
@code
  ref_ptr<FBO> fbo = ref_ptr<FBO>::alloc(width, height);
  ref_ptr<FBOState> fboState = ref_ptr<FBOState>::alloc(fbo);
@endcode

Add a color texture to the render target.
@code
  ref_ptr<Texture> colorAttachment = fbo->addTexture(
      1,
      GL_TEXTURE_2D,
      GL_RGBA, GL_RGBA,
      GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE);
@endcode

Call glDrawBuffer when the regen::FBOState is traversed.
@code
  fboState->addDrawBuffer(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0);
@endcode

Clear depth and color attachments when the tree is traversed.
@code
  ClearColorState::Data clearData;
  clearData.clearColor = Vec4f(0.0f);
  clearData.colorBuffers.push_back(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0);
  fboState->setClearColor(clearData);
  fboState->setClearDepth();
@endcode

Attach the regen::FBO to the render tree.
@code
  ref_ptr<StateNode> fboNode = ref_ptr<StateNode>::alloc(fboState);
  rootNode->addChild(fboNode);
@endcode

Display the color attachment by adding a regen::BlitToScreen state to the render tree.
@code
  ref_ptr<State> blitState = ref_ptr<BlitToScreen>::alloc(
        fbo, screenSize, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0);
  rootNode->addChild(ref_ptr<StateNode>::alloc(blitState));
@endcode

@section tut_cube Rendering a Box

Instantiate the regen::Box mesh, the box is centered at origin.
@code
    Box::Config boxConfig;
    boxConfig = Vec3f(1.0f);
    ref_ptr<Mesh> cube = ref_ptr<Box>::alloc(boxConfig);
@endcode

Move the regen::Box center to another position using the model matrix.
@code
    ref_ptr<ModelTransformation> modelMat = ref_ptr<ModelTransformation>::alloc();
    modelMat->translate(Vec3f(-2.0f, 0.75f, 0.0f), 0.0f);
    cube->joinStates(modelMat);
@endcode

Attach a regen::Material state to the box.
@code
    ref_ptr<Material> material = ref_ptr<Material>::alloc();
    material->set_copper();
    cube->joinStates(material);
@endcode

Attach a regen::Shader state to the box. Note that the shader is not yet loaded.
@code
    ref_ptr<ShaderState> shaderState = ref_ptr<ShaderState>::alloc();
    cube->joinStates(shaderState);
@endcode

Add the box to the render tree. Use regen::FBOState as parent, so that all rendering
is going to the offscreen render target.
@code
    ref_ptr<StateNode> meshNode = ref_ptr<StateNode>::alloc(cube);
    fboState->addChild(meshNode);
@endcode

Configure the shader using the hierarchical tree structure.
@code
    StateConfigurer stateConfigurer;
    stateConfigurer.addNode(meshNode.get());
@endcode

Finally compile the shader that is used to render the cube. Note that the 'regen.models.mesh' shader is used
here. It can be considered as some kind of Uber shader that blanks out a lot of unused functionality using
the shader configuration generated above.
@code
    shaderState->createShader(stateConfigurer.cfg(), "regen.models.mesh");
@endcode
